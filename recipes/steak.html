    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This steak marinade is a family recipe that has been developed only over
      the last 5 years. In this short time, it's made me famous in our close
      circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>olive oil</li>
      <li>Soya sauce</li>
      <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>Ribeye steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, basil,
        garlic powder, parsley, white pepper, minced garlic, and hot pepper
        sauce in a blender; blend on high speed until thoroughly combined, about
        30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 Â½
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the marinade into a resealable plastic bag. Add steak, coat with
        the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the
        refrigerator for up to 8 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the
        remaining marinade. Cook or grill steaks to desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        All that flavorful marinade doesn't have to go to waste, though: You can
        make it safe-to-eat by boiling the liquid for several minutes. This
        process will also reduce the liquid, resulting in a thick sauce that'll
        work well with your freshly cooked steak.
